## Requirements

- PHP <= 7.4
- Laravel = 5.7
- SQLite database
- Docker
- Docker-compose

 This challenge does not require any additional library. DO NOT MODIFY the composer.json or composer.lock file as that may result in a test failure.
 The project already contain a sample SQLite database at /database/database.sqlite. Please don´t change the database structure by creating a seed or migration file because this may also result in a test failure.
